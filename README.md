# Learning Haskell

## Running this code

1.  You need to have a Haskell environment installed on your computer, in my case I'm using GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)
2.  In a terminal, go to the folder and type:

        ghci script.hs

3.  When you run this, if you make changes to the script file, just type in:

        :reload

If you want to know more, feel free to read the I took from the videos I was watching, available in the notes folder. I recommend you start from [First Steps](notes/1-first-steps.md)
